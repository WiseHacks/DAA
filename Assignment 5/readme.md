### Theory

The longest zig-zag subsequence problem is to find length of the longest subsequence of given sequence such that all elements of this are alternating. A sequence is called a zig-zag sequence if the differences between successive elements strictly alternate between positive and negative

### ANALYSIS

**Time Complexity**
|   Approach  |   Time complexity   |
|   --------------  |   ----   |
|    1  | O(n) |
|    2  | O(n^2) |

**Time Complexity**

Space complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
